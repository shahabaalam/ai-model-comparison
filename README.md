### **Bouncing Ball in a Spinning Hexagon**

A Python simulation where a ball bounces inside a rotating hexagon. The ball is affected by **gravity, friction, and realistic collisions** with the moving walls.

---

## **Features**

- üèÄ **Realistic Ball Physics:** Gravity and friction applied to the ball.
- üîÑ **Rotating Hexagon:** The hexagon continuously spins, affecting ball collisions.
- üèé **Dynamic Collision Handling:** The ball bounces off the hexagon walls with accurate reflection angles.
- üé® **Pygame Visualization:** Uses **Pygame** to render real-time movement and physics.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-model-comparison.git
   cd ai-model-comparison
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pygame numpy
   ```
3. **Run the Simulation**
   ```bash
   python bouncing_ball.py
   ```

---

## **Controls**

- `Esc` - Exit the simulation.
- `R` - Restart the ball's position.

---

## **How It Works**

- The **hexagon rotates** at a constant speed.
- The **ball moves under gravity** and **bounces off the walls** realistically.
- **Friction reduces velocity** over time, making the simulation feel natural.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**
- **Pygame** - for rendering.
- **NumPy** - for vector calculations.
